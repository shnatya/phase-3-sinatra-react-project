## Jokes database

Jokes database has four tables: users, jokes, categories, and joke_categories. Between users and jokes tables, there is one-to-many relationship: a joke has only one user, but a user has many jokes. Thanks to this relationship, you can find out the the userâ€™s name who wrote the joke, and also filter out all jokes for a certain user. 
        
Between jokes and categories tables, there is many-to-many relationship: a joke has many categories, and one category has many jokes. This relationship is established in a join table joke_categories with foreign keys - joke_id and category_id. Thanks to this relationship, you can filter jokes by one category.


## Routing using Sinatra

This API has three routes:

- get "/jokes",
- post "/jokes",
- delete "/jokes/:id". 

Working with this routes,  you request jokes from the database, add new jokes to it, and delete jokes from the database, respectively.
